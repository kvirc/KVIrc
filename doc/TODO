Update TODO file, if something is implemented, it should be removed in the TODO file.
Mantain TODO file as clear as possible

Please note that this TODO file is currently unused/unmantained.
The list of user-asked feature request is available at: https://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/report/2

- Events, events, events. There are lots of them pending (see TODO.Events).
- /timer as a module
- It would be cool if KVIrc could to delete old log files automatically
	(configurable, of course), to avoid disk ocupation. For example, delete (or
	move to trash) 15-days old log files automatically (configurable by user).
- html colored logs (with icons ? configurable with an option)
  SHould get the available modes from RPL_ISUPPORT and show them in the box
- CService support
	We already have nickserv support, why not CService/X support? This should be much much easier to
	implement as it's only on one net (Undernet), and with a static host and command that never changes, we
	only need to specify password.
