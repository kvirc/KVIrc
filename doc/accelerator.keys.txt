This is a comprehensive list of all accelerator keys defined in KVIrc.
An accelerator key is a combination of keyboard buttons that, when pressed
toghether, will accomplish an action which otherwise would be done by moving
the mouse or selecting from a menu.

  Some notes on keys:

Under Windows, the Ctrl+Alt is mapped to the AltGr (Alternative Graphics) key.
Since AltGr is used in many keyboard layouts to produce special characters,
the use of any Ctrl+Alt hotkey is discouraged.
A list of standard window hotkeys can be found here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/126449
Under Unix*/KDE, a lot of keys are globally binded to specific software, eg:
	Ctrl+Shift+S shows the contact list of Kopete
	Ctrl+Alt+S stops the music player juk
A list of these can be found at SystemSettings->Keyboard and mouse->Global keyboard shortcuts.
