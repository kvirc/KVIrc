// - A spam message is generally a single PRIVMSG <mynick> :<text>
//		so this function should be (and is) called when
//		a PRIVMSG is received from a person that has no QUERY
//		window open yet.
// - 95% of spam messages contain an URL inside (http,ftp,www) or a channel name.
// - The other 5% contain words like auto-msg, msg me or query <nickname>
// - There are some really common words:
//   free, mp3, sex, teen, porn, pics, girls, babe, pass, user..., hard, join
//
// In this way we can get rid of a good 70% of spam msgs.

		Anti-spam protection
	@keyterms:
		spam
	@body:
		KVIrc contains a small spam detector, and can help you in avoiding that annoying flood
		of queries popping up when you join large channels full of lamers.[br]
		The spam detector works in a rather simple way: when someone sends you a private message
		containing one or more [i]special words[/i], and that user has no open query window,
		so the message is treated as spam and is redirected to the console window or is ignored completely
		(if you enable that option).[br]
		The spam words to check for, can be set by the means of [cmd]option[/cmd] stringlistSpamWords.[br]
		The anti-spam engine can be enabled by setting [cmd]option[/cmd] boolUseAntiSpamOnPrivmsg and
		[cmd]option[/cmd] boolUseAntiSpamOnNotice to 1.[br]
	@examples:
		[example]
			[comment]# This will cause new-query private messages containing[/comment]
			[comment]# words http:, #(channel name), or ftp: to be redirected to the console[/comment]
			[cmd]option[/cmd] stringlistSpamWords http:, #, ftp:, sex, free, chat, join
			[cmd]option[/cmd] boolUseAntiSpamOnPrivmsg 1
			[comment]# This will cause these messages to be completely ignored[/comment]
			[cmd]option[/cmd] boolSilentAntiSpam 1
		[/example]
