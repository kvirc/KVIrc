Description: Corrected the place to show up for the desktop entry.
  Add KDE category. KVIrc is not proposed upstream to be a KDE application
  but rather a Qt one. In Debian we build it with KDE dependencies and hence
  we tag application as KDE in for the menu entry.
  .
  This patch can be studied to be forwarded upstream.
