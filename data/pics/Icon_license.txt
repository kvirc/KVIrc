A thank you to fatcow for releasing this icon set resource, which allowed this work to happen as a result.

Changes:
Many Icons in this Kvirc set have been modified to suit the program functions they intend to illustrate.
Quite a considerable portion of these icons were created in the same style and did not exist in the set and are exclusive to Kvirc.

To keep things simple this Kvirc set license is same as original http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/
