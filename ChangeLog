   - KVIrc Script: 'WordBreak' alignment type for the hbox, vbox and label

==================================================================================

02 May 2007 - 12 March 2008
   [KVIrc Development Team]
   - A lot of changes documented in the svn log. See http://svn.kvirc.de/kvirc/ for the timeline.

02 May 2007
   [Alexey]
   - New KVS functions: $serialize and $unserialize to deal with JSON-serialized strings

16 Apr 2007
   [Noldor] (with the input from Pragma and Iakko)
   - Iakko's notifier is back. New in this version:
     1) QT4 compatible (on win and macos it is uses fast setWindowOpacity effect instead internal notifier blend())
	 2) Added Option to disable fadein/out effect useful on slow machine (need test)
	 3) Fixed strange crash on QT4 and some minor bug in show/hide event. (it is a trick... need to debug)
	 This a w.i.p. and need some test on linux.

12 Apr 2007
   [TheXception]
   - Added $system.call to call functions of dll/so files via kvs.

10 Apr 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Configurable avatar scaling on load
   - Human-redable file sized on dcc transfers

12 Mar 2007
   [Alexey]

   - Added option to configure identd output mode

06 Mar 2007
   [Pragma]
   - Added svg and generated png icons for kvs,kvc,kvt and kva files.
     Added the KDE mimetypes too.
   - Some fixes for Qt4 support

26 Feb 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Added Export/Import feature to channel list module

25 Feb 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Repainted reuser list
   - Added search field for mask editors

24 Feb 2007
   [Noldor]
   - New QT4 win compiling projects: still unusable... kvilib and kvirc compile but only in release;
     you need to compile qt libraries by yourself then try to compile kvilib and kvirc (use COMPILE_USE_QT4 in kvi_wincfg.h).
     Some module compile without problem... others need to be ported.

20 Feb 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Completely reworked ignore system
   - Implemented reguser match caching
   - Implemented custom color for registered user caching
   [Pragma]
   - Yet more Qt4 port.
     - We now require Qt >= 4.2.2 for Qt4 support to work. Older 4.x versions
       have bugs that can't be worked around and tend to crash kvirc
       in various circumstances (including displaying tooltips).
       Qt 4.2 also re-adds the possibility to add QWidget objects to popup menus.
     - Yet more modules ported.
   - A fix for the KVS expression operator precedence.
   - A couple of general fixes that I can't remember but have been reported on
     the list.
   - I'm thinking about qmake support (as suggested by Matteo Catanese some time ago)
     ... will require some work ... what do you think about it ?

18 Feb 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Fixed dns resolver under win32
   - Fixed minimized channels open
   - Added bot detection icon (who will write docs?)
   - Fixed winamp plugin problem under win32 (removed msvcr80.dll dependency)

08 Feb 2007
   [Pragma]
   - More Qt 4.x port.
     Solved the most disturbing problems: it looks a lot better now.
     - Font metric cache values can no longer be computed directly from a
       widget's font. We must use the painter idea of the font instead.
       This complicates caching a bit.
     - Some of the QPainter functions seem to behave in a bit different way
     - QFrame::drawContents() is gone... we need to reimplement paintEvent()
     - The setAutoFillBackground(false) setting seems to be propagated to children
       in some way (?) (as opposed to backgroundMode(NoBackground) in Qt3)
     - QToolButton::drawButton() is gone, need to directly drawPixmaps instead...
     - ...
     Ported also the first couple of modules.

     Qt 4 causes a lot of problems in porting but I'm starting to feel
     like the new library is very cool :)

05 Feb 2007
   [Pragma]
   - The KVIrc executable now compiles and starts with Qt4. With Qt3 everythin
     should work just like it did before.

     No modules are ported yet so a lot of functionality is not available...
     ... but it CAN connect to a server :)
     It tends to crash once in a while, has nasty problems with
     graphics and size of certain widgets: will need some hours of debugging.

     When testing the Qt4 port make sure you (re)move your old binary
     modules from /usr/local/share/kvirc/3.2/. KVIrc will attempt to load
     some modules from there and since they're linked to Qt3 the runtime
     (loader) is likely to go nuts with two Qt versions in memory.
     You have been warned... :)

30 Jan 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Introduced option "using identd only on connect"

29 Jan 2007
   [Alexey]
   - Introduced search in log files

25 Jan 2007
   [Pragma]
   - Yet more Qt 4.x port
   - Added the torrent interface module by Alexander Stillich

21 Jan 2007
   [Pragma]
   - More Qt 4.x port
   - More multiple identities work
   - Added the first considerations about the Qt 4.x port to hackers.guide.txt

20 Jan 2007
   [Pragma]
   - Another quick fix (for config values not saved correctly)
   - Started the implementation of multiple identities.

19 Jan 2007
   [Pragma]
   - Added the fixes for a couple of bugs introduced with the yesterday commit.
     Thnx to Alexander Stillich for the detailed report :)

18 Jan 2007
   [Pragma]
   - More Qt 4.x port. kvilib now compiles cleanly with both Qt 4.x and Qt 3.x.
     Don't know if it really works since kvirc compilation still bails out. We'll see :)

15 Jan 2007
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed the smart encoders a bit more
   - Theme management: rewritten the theme save dialog as a wizard, added screenshot management.
   - Really first step to Qt 4.x support: added ./configure switches to handle qt4 and
     fiddled the makefile variables to contain the right include and library paths.
     Still have no idea if everything works correctly since compilation bails out
     very early in kvilib.
     You're likely to have problems with moc since the configure script tends
     to find the Qt 3.x moc instead of the correct one. Use the --with-qt4-moc option
     to force the right moc compiler path.
     In Qt 4.x mode the COMPILE_USE_QT4 preprocessor variable is set: use it for conditionals...
     an #ifdef COMPILE_USE_QT4 is more or less equivalent to #if QT_VERSION >= 0x040000.
     We will need to "abstract" several collection classes to make everything
     work with both Qt 3.x and Qt 4.x. The goal is (or better would be) to hide everything in
     kvilib in order to have almost no conditional compilation in the kvirc core and in the modules.
   - Added a discussion about the versioning scheme in the hackers.guide.txt. Give
     it a read and make/add your comments :)

   - Added handling of unknown RPL_WHOIS* numeric replies by implementing a nice
     "guessing" algorithm suggested by Elephantman
   - Added a file with KVIrc file extension definitions. We should use the defs instead
     of hardcoding extensions like .kvt, .kvs or .kvp.
   - Added a fast generic packaging engine. A KVIrc package is a kind of zip archive
     with an uncompressed metadata header. It can be used to distribute both themes and addons.
   - First works on the theme exporting engine. Saving and packaging are now different operations.
     One first saves his theme to disk, eventually edits it manually (maybe by adding a nice
     splash screen or fixing some icons) and finally packages it by invoking a nice
     wizard based procedure. Still need to write the installation dialog.
   - Moved the whole theme management engine to a new module. It exports the
     management dialogs and some utility commands. There is no reason to load
     all this stuff at startup with the options dialog now.

     added code completition (shift+insert keys), added a dynamic help: move over a command/function.
     then right button and "help command/function" (... its in beta status, need some workaround :D) :

   - added some options to hide graphic elements in the gui to build a very "minimalist" KVIrc.

15 Jun 2005
   [Grifisx/Noldor]
   - code improvements in the editor(...a work in progress):
     added find/replace in alias editor, fixed some bugs and added some user friendly feature.
     To do: code completition;

   [Pragma]
   - Fixed the CTRL+D terminal window crash
   - Fixed the Rijndael encryption module

22 Feb 2004: 3.2.0 "Realia" released.

20 Feb 2005
   [Pragma/Iakko/Noldor/Grifisx]
   - Several fixes on the notifier
   - A lot of enchancements in the objects module (some new classes
     and some extensions to the existing ones)
   - Improved auto-resume DCC handling: now files are not
     auto-resumed when the incoming size is unknown or smaller
     than the existing file. The auto-resume is disabled also
     if there is a running transfer with the same loca file name.
   - Fixed several bugtrack issues.
   - Cleaned up the -ansi -pedantic compilation. It looks that
     only one real warning remains and it is related to the "deprecated"
     flags of KApplication constructor which will be removed
     in KDE 4.0. We must live with it for a while.
     All the other warnings are due to the system headers.
   - Caught a couple of potential segmentation faults in the reguser
     module.
   - Committed the catalan translation by Marc Serra

09 Feb 2005
   [Tom]
   - Fixed several positioning issues for widgets with saved geometry
     on MacOS X

09 Feb 2005:
   [Noldor/Grifisx]
   - Added the KVS process class
   - Several fixes for other object classes
   - Added Drag&Drop support to the queries: now a drop operation
     triggers the OnQueryFileDropped event
   - Added support for CTRL+K, CTRL+B, CTRL+U, CTRL+I ... escapes
     in the topic widget.

08 Feb 2005:
   [Noldor/Grifisx]
   - Added the KVS radiobutton class

08 Feb 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed the bug of KviIrcView that caused the background to be repainted
     incorrectly when the mouse was hovering over the links
   - Private background now has priority even over the global transparency
   - Added a menu option to reset the private background pixmap when no longer needed
   - Removed the "FrameCaption" option since it was only freaking the people
     out when it wasn't updated on version change...

07 Feb 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Finally managed to handle correctly the IME events: text input for chinese/japanese
     korean etc... should work now.
   - Fixed the logging of emoticons: they are written to the log files now
   - More tricks on KviHeapObject
   - Added the fixes for the _horrible_ VC++ compiler bug that implicitly
     creates helper functions (vftable entries) residing in code sections where
     operator new is called on a class with a virtual destructor. This is
     simply destructive when it happens in a module that can be unloaded
     before the object allocated with new is destroyed: at delete time
     the code flow obviously jumps into no man's land.
   - Committed the ldcnumber class by Noldor and Griffisx

04 Feb 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Added the fixes for windows segfaults reported and bughunted by Noldor and Grifisx.
     Maybe these KviHeapObject trick will help to solve the issue.
   - Added a warning message about sending more than 20 lines of text
     at once in a query or channel. The warning can be obviously disabled
     forever by answering "Always".
   - Added the XIM "hot spot" handling for the input window.


01 Feb 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Bandwidth limits for DCC finished. They are configurable "on the fly" now.
   - Fixed the Ctrl+Arrows and Ctrl+Shift+Arrows behaviour: now they skip/select
     entire words in the input widget. Window switching has been moved to
     Alt+Arrows and Alt+Shift+Arrows.

31 Jan 2005:
   [Noldor/Grifisx]
   - Yet more object classes: time for spinbox and slider.

30 Jan 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - DCC Bandwidth limit implemented, "on the fly setting" is still missing tough

29 Jan 2005:
   [Iakko]
   - Added Notifier 2.0 in a more stable and usable version, now tabs and
     "blinking onFocusOut/showing" are working. The Notifier is still on Beta version.
   - Some kvi_sp_literal.cpp and kvi_sp_ctcp.cpp (under kvirccvs/kvirc/src/kvirc/sparser) changes
     needed for notifier to work. A core recompilation is suggested even if
     not strongly necessary.. it's a matter of string output on the notifier, nothing critical.
   - Graphic features are waiting to be added asap.

29 Jan 2005:
   [Noldor/Grifisx]
   - Added a new widget class "progressbar" with the following functions:
        $setProgress, $setTotalSteps, $reset, $setCenterIndicator,
        $setPercentageVisible, $isCenterIndicator, $isPercentageVisible

28 Jan 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Added the possibility of exporting toolbars from the toolbar
     customization dialog. The export function can also export
     the associated actions.
   - Moved the toolbar customization dialog to a separate module
   - Added the mircryption/blowfish crypt engine. It actually supports
     both the standard ECB mode and the (really) new CBC mode.
   - Fixed some remaining bugs in the action editor: now it should
     be ready for the public :)
   - Added a couple of object functions to the layout object class
     to support the nice minesweeper script :D
   - A full set of action.* and toolbar.* commands is now available
   - Added compatibility loading functions for old toolbars
   - Added handling of the ERROR server message.
   - Added the support for actions that can be enabled only in
     specified windows and only if there is a nonempty selection inside.
     This allows to create user toolbars that perform quick actions
     on the selected channel users. This is a *really* quick kick
     for example.
   - Fixed a couple of bugs related to the mask handling
   - Fixed a possible bug related to acknowledges in the DCC send code
   - Other small fixes all around as usual.


27 Jan 2005:
   [Noldor/Grifisx]
   - added $setFont to the class widget,$setDragEnabled and $setInputMask
     to the lineedit class;

20 Jan 2005:
   [Noldor/Grifisx]
   - added some new functions to the class widget: $setToolTip,
     $setForegroundColor,...
   - some code improvements in the win version of the filetransferwindow:
     added context menu like open,open with,delete file,open destination folder

8 Jan 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Added handling for ERROR and the relevant OnError event.

7 Jan 2005:
   [Pragma]
   - Again more than 20 days of changes to report.
   - The action based toolbars are almost working and have replaced
     completely the old scriptable toolbars.
   - The toolbar customisation dialog is ready
   - Actioneditor is almost ready too, needs just minor adjustments
   - Added $chan.userJoinTime() and $chan.userLastActionTime()
   - Added several new $mask() types: now it is possible to get different
     host masks (only *.domain.ext or *.anything.anythingelse.domain.ext).
     Another mask set tries to handle correctly the hidden hostnames (+x)
     on some servers (this does not work 100% tough...)
   - Added the initial stuff for the language recognition module. Still
     don't know if it will end up in the official release: needs interfacing with
     the core... but the standalone engine is starting to work.
   - Added several "smart" encodings that will try to decode as UTF8 first
     and then apply the local encoding rules.
   - Added a couple of new emoticon images (Thnx Penny!, Thnx Sidhe! :)
   - Created the "scripts" cvs module and added a first script example
     (a simple ezbounce irc proxy interface)
   - Fixed runtime localization of the action and toolbar names: they
     should work fine now.
   - Fixed some bugs in the objects module (still needs a lot of work)
     signaled by Noldor.
   - Bumped up libtool and ltmain.sh to 1.5.10 (hoping that it will stop
     relinking the modules when installing... this is extremely annoying)
   - Suggest installing the default script if no toolbars or popups are available
   - Fixed http avatars not being correctly loaded after the transfer has finised.
   - Iakko is working hard on the new (cool!) notifier interface :)
   - Various other fixes all around

15 Dec 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Hacked the avatar cache to support masked ip addresses
     (added some new parameter options to the $mask function by the way)
   - Added the possibility of setting a temporary background for any IRC view.
     This is still an experiment.

12 Dec 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added minimal support for /DCC ALLOW
   - Fixed config files loading that truncated lines longer than 32K

8 Dec 2004:
   [Pragma]
   Yet another huge set of commits.
   The major changes are:
   - New "action" based toolbar and popup menu system.
     Now the user can just drag & drop actions to customize toolbars :)
   - The "big cleanup" has started:
     - "Scripttoolbar" is gone: the functionality is completely superseded by
       the action based toolbars now. I already know that some people will want to kill
       me for this but from now on the actions are the only method to create toolbars.
       This is a good idea since the old method was a bit ugly (for example because
       it needed overriding events to enable/disable the actions).
       Moreover, another piece of the old non-unicode parser has been wiped out: this is Good(TM).
     - Module extension toolbars are gone: replaced by the action stuff now (see above).
   - Several structural changes to the default script that reflect the changes in the core.
     It IS a good idea to reparse it (execute default script) once now.

4 Nov 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed various minor bugs introduced with the last huge commit.
   - Merged the Mirco Macrelli's patch that adds the chanowner flag
     support.

1 Nov 2004:
   [Pragma]
   I've missed to update this file for a while: my fault :/
   The major changes until now are:
   - New statusbar showing the server information.
     This is intended to replace the irc context applet which
     often has problems with space.
   - 5 moveable statusbar applets
   - Per network settings: nick,user,OnLogin,OnConnect,NickServ
     authentication etc. as per-network settings.
   - Both the servers and the networks can have a preferred
     encoding now.
   - More UNICODE support all around: the encodings are honored
     almost anywhere with the exception of the scripting engine.
     The scripting engine uses a hack that makes the encodings
     survive through trivial scripts too. This will become yet
     better when the new KVS core will be ready.
   - Support for unicode nicks and channel names.
     In fact almost anything that the server sends out may be unicode
     data encoded with some 16->8bit scheme.
   - A new rewritten lag meter that will avoid to ping the server
     if possible (when other lag-check probes are spontaneously
     being sent). The improved algorithm computes the lag better
     and does not "hang up" when the server doesn't reply at all.
   - The default quit and part messages can contain scripting identifiers
     that are evaluated at quit or part time.
   - The windows problem with keyboard input has been resolved
   - Several enchancements to the actual scripting engine including
     but not limited to echoprivmsg, query, notice, notifier.* ,
     perl.*, server, ...
   - Added OnDisconnectRequest event
   - Added support for /CODEPAGE
   - Avoided unnecessary repaints when in SDI mode: this made
     KVIrc a bit faster when switching windows and lowered
     the overall cpu usage.
   - The "unread" text in a window is now clearly marked by a horizontal
     line in the text view. If the text line is out of the view
     then a triangle in the upper corner of the view signals it.
   - KviWStr stuff definitively removed :)))
   - Several other minor bugtrack issues fixed.


6 Aug 2004:
   [Juanjo]
   - Make some pointer = 0 after delete assignations when:
     Pointer is a member pointer or a global pointer.
     The delete is not in a destructor.
     It makes sense.

1 Aug 2004:
   [Juanjo]
   - Added an autopackage dir with two (very initial) apsepc files to build a
     .autopackage autoinstaller.
     If you have not
	 checked autopackage (http://autopackage.org) DO IT NOW :) is the real
	 solution for Linux third party software installation across distributions
	 (somewhat like autoconf at the binary installation level, but without
	 damn M4 :)

20 Jul 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Now you can use perl from KVS and KVS from perl :)
     See /help perl.begin

13 Jul 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Perl support has been widely requested. Added the initial modules
     for that purpose. Needs more work tough.
   - More work on the notifier: now it's fully working.
     Added also the options to disable it in several ways (even completely).
   - Fixed various bugs all around

11 Jul 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added /AHOST command
   - More work on the notifier, now it flashes, pops up only when really
     needed and can be temporairly disabled.
   - Hardwired the event manager of the new KVS engine and officially
     killed the old uparser based event manager. We're getting closer and
     closer...

08 Jul 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added the notifier module: really nice!
     Thnx to Penny for the images :)

06 Jul 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added a Always/Yes/No message box that asks the user for confirmation
     when attempting to close a connected console.
   - Added the Always/Yes/No option to the "Quit-Kvirc-On-Close-Last-Console"
     operation.
   - Fixed the input history handling bug as reported by Soliton
   - Added several fixes for UNICODE misbehaviours reported by Dusan
   - Fixed the configuration files parsing: now the entries
     and the keys have whitespace encoded separately and the UTF8
     encoding/decoding is done in the proper places.
   - Added the code to make the translation of the tips possible.
     The translations MUST be UTF8 encoded and use the
     libkvitip_<lang>.kvc name.
   - Finally fixed the copy&paste behaviour:
     In the input the selection and the middle click
     use QClipboard::Selection if supported by the operating system.
     All the other methods use QClipboard::Clipboard.
     The IRCView now copies to both QClipboard::Clipboard and
     QClipboard::Selection (if supported)
   - Again huge structural reorganizing in the networking stack
     now I start to like it :)
   - Committed several translation updates by Dusan
   - The reconnect timer can now be stopped before it triggers
     and on disconnect it uses the correct server entry.
     (see Trisk's ChangeLog entry for 12 Mar 2004).

26 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed a mismatched new[]/delete pair in kvi_locale.cpp
   - More KviConsole->KviIrcConnection moving
   - Fixed a couple of potential segvs related to the connection management
   - More UNICODE fixes all around

24 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Yet more bug fixing
   - Added the cs translations of the modules and fixed some unicode issues reported by Dusan

21 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed a bug introduced by the previous fix about date encodings :D
   - Fixed log files not being properly encoded to UTF-8 (question: should
       the logs be UTF-8, use the local encoding or use the source window charset ?)
   - Committed more work on kvirc_cs.po by Dusan Hokuv

20 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - More reorganizing of the networking stack
   - Fixed some bugs with encoding of the dates in non-English locales

16 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]

   - More reorganizing of the networking stack

12 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - A lot of UNICODE updates
   - More reorganizing of the networking stack
   - Added a lot of new text encodings including the missing ISO-8859-XX variants
     and some CPXXX.

4 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added first bulgarian translation by bugar@developer.bg
   - Completely reorganized the <KviConsole,KviIrcContext,KviIrcLink,KviIrcConnection,KviIrcSocket>
        class set. Now it should become more usable/readable/manteinable/coherent ...
        Really work in progress: expect misbehaviour and compile time warnings about
                                 deprecated functions...

2 Jun 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added profiling support (--enable-profiling)

31 May 2004: 3.0.1 "System Virtue" released.

11-30 May 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - More console splitting , still not finished
   - Created the initial hackers guide document (this will be always work in progress)
   - Fixed some online doc bugs
   - Fixed a bug with popup menu prologues not being saved correctly
   - Fixed a SEGV related to focus management
   - Fixed a couple of translation related SEGVS
   - Preserved UNICODE in the logs by encoding to UTF-8
        (maybe this should be the local 8 bit ? feedback will be needed later)
   - Fixed several typos and dead links in the documentation signaled
        by Klaus Weidenbach
   - Added a couple of window.* module commands/functions
   - Unicode fixes related to IrcView tooltips
   - Added $msgtype function and fixed the related echo documentation
   - Added the export function in the event editor
   - Fixed a bug in the popup export function that caused extpopup entries
        without icons to be exported as simple popups (thnx again Klaus).
   - Added an option to redirect WHOIS replies to the active window (on by default)
   - Added the /echoprivmsg command
   - Added the "delete file" function to the file transfers window
   - Various fixes all around

10 May 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed the problem with tooltips displaying the wrong avatar image
   - Started splitting KviConsole in smaller logical classes (irc context, irc connection)

06 May 2004:
   [Trisk]
   - Changed parsing for 004 numeric, properly works with hybrid now.

17 Apr 2004: 3.0.0 "Awakening" released.

16 Apr 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Fixed a bug with creation of KviWindow derived classes: the constructor
     of the base class was calling virtual functions from subclasses (it is curious
     that this was effectively failing only on Windows and not on Linux).
   - Reworked a bit the str module to avoid compiler parameter passing problems
   - Fixed a bug with $str.replacenocase
   - Fixed a bug that prevented the color option selector buttons from
     displaying the proper color
   - Miscellaneous fixes for the release

15 Apr 2004:
   [Trisk]
   - Miscellaneous minor stuff (set avatars to 0 width/height to disable).
   - More reasonable defaults (seriously, the coloured nicks hurt people's
     eyes =\ ). The fact that unrecognised commands result in parse errors
     confuses new users (and annoys the heck out of me, too). Turned off
     message icons too. Rationale is that it will disgust former
     epic/BX/irssi/xchat users.
   - And, I don't think most new users will use avatars regularly, so turning
     the nicklist grid off by default, since it makes the nicklist more
     cluttered.
   * Forgot to add nick completion suffix. Oh well, the 3.0 series is just
     beginning...
   - Almost forgot to clean up really bad spelling in tip of the day. ><

13 Apr 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added the default low-resolution (Minimalist) and high-resolution
     (fancy) themes
   - Added the selection of the default theme at first setup
   - Added one time nickname generation at first startup
   - Modified the Identity dialog to handle better the multiple
     nickname alternatives. The combobox was not that intuitive
     thus added a separate dialog for the alternatives.
   - Removed the "Change now" button from the Identity dialog: it never
     worked correctly.
   - Fixed the "concurrency" crash reported on the mailing list
   - Fixed a SEGV related to shared files
   - Fixed an infinite loop in the toolbar editor
   - Fixed a bug with the Color Selector not displaying the right color on windows
   - Adjusted acinclude.m4.in to handle the new icons added by Trisk: still not
     installed in the proper locations
   - Added a couple of GUI option pages that were really missing (mdi captions
     and toolbar applets)
   - A couple of new icons added
   - Fixed a couple of strange behaviours of the input widget
   - Some source code rearrangements all around
   - More things that I can't remember :D

11 Apr 2004:
   [Trisk]
   - New application icon by Arty2 / Hercules Papatheodorou
     <papirakl@REMOVEotenet.gr>, updated icon set.
   * Too lazy to get icons installing in proper locations.

08 Apr 2004:
   [Pragma]
   - Added the highly requested /exec command in the core
   - Also added an example script that runs an interactive telnet
     session and sends mail with the use of /exec: powerful :)
   - Fixed a script editor highlighting bug
   - Fixed another problem with overlapping dns queries...
     ... it should have been written this way from the beginning :D
   - Miscellaneous changes & fixes all around...

06 Apr 2004:
   [Trisk]
   - Fixed null KviWStr problem.
   - Fixed /$sw(e) crash.

04 Apr 2004:
   [Trisk]
   - Hacked KviWStr to use QTextCodec instead of charset translation tables. =P
   *** Chinese, Japanese, Korean seem to work!
   - Fixed encoding names.
   - Added ISO 8859-9 (Latin-5 Turkish, requested), Big5, GB18030, SJIS,
     EUC-KR, TIS-620.
   - Added options to not show tooltips in taskbar and userlist.

    - Added the IrcContextToolbar to the toolbars menu, now it can be hidden

      from left to right (in the image) instead of top to bottom.
    - Re-added $window to kvi_kvs_corefunctions_sz.cpp : it's the new parser
      version and it will replace the old parser's version in the near future.
      If you want to test the new parser capabilities then run the commands
      by preceding them with a dash:
      /- echo "This is the new parser's version of echo"
      /- echo $window this is the new parser's version of echo \$window
      ...

    - Removed border from channel state and mode icons in user list view and
      lined up icons with text when avatar is used.

    [Pragma]
    - Added avatar caching
    - Reworked the code that remembers the last irc server connected in each

      merged the two solutions in something yet better.
    - Obscure internals: reworked KviIrcMask interface a bit...
      still needs QString porting

    - Output correct message when RPL_CHANNELMODEIS is used for user modes.
    - URL highlighting matches only if followed by char greater than 46.

      from block attributes). Shift-select strips codes from the selection.
    - Consoles remember last nick (correctly now).
    - PART, TOPIC, and MODE messages will use current channel if no argument.
      KICK will send proper command if no reason specified.

    * Put timer in KviTimerManager for lack of a better place, somebody check
      that this is correct, please...
    - Changed tree window list to show server name for consoles of console caption
      (too long to view). Set bold font for consoles.
    - Fixed channel name showing up twice on part when no message is specified
    - Made external messages (whois info, server notices, etc.) go to console by
      default, added option ExternalMessagesToActiveWindow to override this.
    - Also fixed opnotice (NOTICE @#chan) and made non-query private notices and
      privmsg go to common channel.
    - Replaced CPPFLAGS in all Makefile.am with AM_CPPFLAGS.
    - Made channels missing request mask list when mask list editor is opened.
    - Changed KviIrcMask::getHostDomainMaskPtr() to strip only first part of host;

      more specific bans, same as getIpDomainMaskLen().
    * This code was already there, but commented out - why?

      using $lag.lag()).
    - Added the event 'OnLagCheck' that get triggered every time there is a
      new lag data. This should help scripters to write their own lagmeters

         useful on very crowded channels with lots of parallel conversations
