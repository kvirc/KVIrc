    <td>Here comes a small list of <i>coding tips</i>.<br>
These apply to programming in general, not only to KVIrc scripting.<br>
<br>
1. <b>Comment your code</b><br>
A well commented code is easy to maintain, and easy to read by others.<br>
<br>
2. <b>Indent your code</b><br>
Indentation increases the code readability; this is again for you and
other developers that will be going to read your code.<br>
<br>
3. <b>Use TABS to indent your code</b><br>
...and use <b>only tabs</b> to indent.<br>
Tabs are better than space since most code editors allow you
to set the tab since and thus to have the indentation steps smaller or bigger.<br>
This is really important since the indentation size is really a matter of personal taste.<br>
Mixing spaces and tabs is Evil (tm), since it makes the code look really
ugly in editors that have the tab size different than yours; in some cases the
code gets really unreadable.<br>
<br>
4. <b>Use descriptive variable names</b><br>
Using 'foo' as variable name implies tracing its semantic the next
time that you're going to read the code that uses it.<br>
This is really annoying and time-consuming, especially if the project
is getting large.<br>
Obviously using <i>thisIsACounterVariable</i> as name for a simple counter
is also a suicide.<br>
A good convention on variable names can speed up writing, debugging and maintaining code.<br>
Encoding the type of the variable in the variable name might be also a good idea,
but this is a matter of taste; personally I feel really well with that.<br>
Just as example, here go my fundamental convention rules for C++:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The type of the variable is encoded at the beginning of the variable name:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- b prefix for the boolean variables<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i prefix for signed integers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- u prefix for unsigned integers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- f and d prefixes for floating point stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- sz prefix for strings (this is rather for string classes)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pointers have a <b>p</b> prefix prepended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Global variables start with a <b>g_</b> prefix<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Member variables start with a <b>m_</b> prefix<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Exception comes for local variables with obvious semantics<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- i,j,k,l for local loop counters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>aux</i> and <i>tmp</i> for local obvious short-term temporary variables<br>
<br>
So actually by <b>only</b> reading <i>g_pszQuitMessage</i> I know that this is a global pointer to a string variable
containing a quit message. :)<br>
