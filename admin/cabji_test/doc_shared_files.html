The <i>file offers</i> are a simple way to share your files with other IRC users.<br>
Basically, you setup an offer by selecting a local file, choosing a <i>visible name</i> for it.
Remote users will be able to request you the file and download it automatically by
issuing a simple DCC GET request.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Details</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Each offer refers to an existing file on one of your locally mounted file systems.
The offer is given a visible name that the remote users will effectively request.
To share the file /usr/arch/mp3/SonataArctica_SingInSilence_Live.mp3 you will add a file offer
with /usr/arch/mp3/SonataArctica_SingInSilence_Live.mp3 as real file path, something like
<i>SonataArctica_SingInSilence.mp3</i>. A remote user will then request you a DCC GET SonataArctica_SingInSilence.mp3
and KVIrc will automatically send the file.<br>
Each file offer has an <i>user mask</i> that the requesting remote users must match to
obtain the file: *!*@* matches any user, Pragma!*@* matches any user with nickname pragma,
*!*@*.omnikron.net matches any user coming from the omnikron.net domain.<br>
Each offer can have an expire time: the offer will be automatically removed after
a defined number of seconds. An expire time of '0' seconds means that the offer should never expire.<br>
If you have two file offers with the same name and different file, the remote user can
use an additional <i>size</i> parameter in the DCC GET request.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Security issues</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
This is a nice but unsecure method of sharing files.<br>
The user mask is a good protection but you have to use it properly!<br>
Setting the user mask to Nick!*@* can be easily exploited (just by making a user disconnect
in one of the well known ways and then by using his nickname).<br>
On the other side, the remote end must know exactly the visible name of the offer to request
and no one but you will tell him that name.<br>
In sum:<br>
Don't share any really important files: this *might* be like putting it on your webpage :D<br>
Please don't send complaints if someone steals your /etc/passwd : it is because you have permitted that.<br>
