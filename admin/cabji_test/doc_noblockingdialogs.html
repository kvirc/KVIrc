    <td>Why are there no blocking dialogs in KVIrc?<br>
The answer is simple: because they're more confusing and tricky than it seems.<br>
Blocking the entire program control flow while showing a dialog is
rather a bad idea since we have to deal with external entities (servers and other users)
that are <b>not</b> blocked. This means that the blocking dialogs must block only the
script control-flow but let the rest of the application running.
Such blocking dialogs actually seem to simplify scripting because
the programmer <i>feels</i> that the control is always left in the script snippet that he is writing.
This is actually confusing: the control IS in the script snippet but while the dialog
is open the whole world can change: you can return from the dialog call and discover
that the server connection no longer exists and the application is about to quit.<br>
This may happen even with non-blocking dialogs,but in non-blocking mode you have
a way to handle this event. Consider the following snippet of code:
</td></tr><tr><td class="example-box"><pre><code class="c"><br>
echo My name is $?<br>
</code></pre></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Where $? stands for a blocking input dialog that asks the user for some text.<br>
When the input dialog returns the window that the echo was directed to no longer
exists and you have no way to stop the echo! (Well... I could add extra code
in the executable to handle all these situations but that would be really too expensive).<br>
With object scripting this is actually dangerous: you might use a blocking dialog
in an object signal handler and when returning discover that this object has been deleted!
(The example refers to a simple object, but think about a complex hierarchy of objects
where one random gets deleted...).<br>
This is why the dialogs in KVIrc are non-blocking :)<br>
That's REAL programming.
