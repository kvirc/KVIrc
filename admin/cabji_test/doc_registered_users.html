The registered user database is basically a set of users with associated
<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">irc-masks</a> and properties.<br>
It is used to recognize users on IRC and associate properties to them.<br>
This works more or less like the IRC ban list, K-Line list, or invite list.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">User entry</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
A registered user database entry is identified by a <b>unique</b> name.<br>
It may be the nickname of the user that you want to match, or the real name (if you know it)
or any other string (even with spaces). The name is an <i>internal identifier</i> for the user entry:
each name maps to a single entry and each entry has a single name.<br>
Each entry has a set of registration <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">irc-masks</a>: these masks
are used to recognize the user on IRC.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Registration masks</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
The masks have the common IRC mask format: <b>&lt;nick&gt;!&lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;</b><br>
The masks may contain <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> wildcards that match any portion of text.<br>
<b>*!*@*</b><br>
<b>Pragma!*@*</b><br>
<b>*!~daemon@*</b><br>
<b>Pragma!*daemon@*.it</b><br>
<b>Pragma!?daemon@some*.it</b><br>
<b>Pragma!~daemon@some.host.it</b><br>
Are examples of valid registration masks.<br><br>
The masks with wildcards can actually match more than a single user.<br>
For example the mask *!root@*.host.com will match all the users
having root as username and coming from the host.com domain.<br>
For this reason putting wildcards in nicknames could become a problem
if not used carefully (but may also be used to achieve interesting tricks).<br>
If you don't use wildcards in nicknames you are sure that
in a single IRC connection, a mask will always refer to a single user.<br>
You will commonly use the following format:<br>
<b>&lt;nick&gt;!*&lt;username&gt;@*.&lt;host&gt;.&lt;top&gt;</b><br>
or<br>
<b>&lt;nick&gt;!*&lt;username&gt;@&lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;.*</b><br>
In this way you can be 95% sure that the mask will really match the correct user.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Example of registration and lookups</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Assume that you want to register a friend of yours: Derek Riggs.<br>
Derek often uses <i>Eddie</i> as his nickname
<i>stranger</i> as username and has a dial-up connection that makes his IP address appear as
&lt;variable-number&gt;.somewhere.in.time.org.<br>
You will add an entry with name <i>Derek Riggs</i> and a registration mask like the following:<br>
<b>Eddie!stranger@*.somewhere.in.time.org.</b><br>
If the IRC servers keep adding strange characters (<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">prefixes</a>) at the beginning of his username you may use;<br>
<b>Eddie!*stranger@*.somewhere.in.time.org.</b><br>
If Eddie also often connects from the wasted.years.org domain and gets <i>eddie</i> as username there,
you might add a second registration mask as follows:<br>
<b>Eddie!*eddie@*.wasted.years.org.</b><br>
An alternative could be use only one mask with *.org as domain and allow any username (Eddie!*@*.org) but this
could become dangerous since it could match the users that you don't want to.<br>
On the other hand, if you dislike the users with the nickname Eddie that come from .org
and you're implementing an auto-kick system, the correct mask to register is <i>Eddie!*@*.org</i>.
<br><br>
KVIrc tries to be smart, and always find the most correct match for a user:
If you have two masks registered: <b>Pragma!*xor@*.myisp.it</b> and <b>*!*@*.myisp.it</b>,
KVIrc will match <b>Pragma!~xor@233-dyn.myisp.it</b> with the first one even if the second
one also matches; the first one however, is a best match.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Properties</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
A registered user has an (eventually empty) set of properties
defined by name/value pairs. (In versions prior to 3.0.0 flags were used instead,
but revealed to be insufficient).<br>
KVIrc recognizes some of these properties and associates semantic actions to it; other properties
are left for scripting extension. Property names are case insensitive.<br>
One of the recognized properties is the <i><a href="doc_notify_list.html">notify</a></i> property.<br><br>
When a user is found to have this property set to a special value
KVIrc will attempt to track the user presence on IRC.
Another one is the <a href="doc_avatar.html">avatar</a> property. Its value should be the
name of the <i>default</i> <a href="doc_avatar.html">avatar image file</a> for the specified user.<br>
The <i>ignore</i> property should be set to <i>1</i> (or <i>true</i>) for users that have to be ignored (:D).
