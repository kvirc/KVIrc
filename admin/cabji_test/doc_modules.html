    <td>Starting from version 2.0.0, KVIrc includes support for external plugins:
parts of code that can be loaded at runtime. This support was optional
and the main KVIrc functionality was independent of that support.
In version 3.0.0 the <i>modularity</i> became one of the primary KVIrc features.
These pieces of external code are now named <i>modules</i>. The module
support has been rewritten completely to extend the available features
and remove some <i>basic</i> problems that were present in 2.0.0.
This caused the old <i>plugins</i> to be binary incompatible with the new KVIrc
executable; anyway, most old <i>plugins</i> have been rewritten as <i>modules</i>
and included in the 3.0.0 distribution. Some of the basic KVIrc features
are based on modules now; for example, the help browser is now in an
external library called <i>libkvihelp.so</i>. This allows to keep the basic
KVIrc executable smaller and faster (in some phases).
Module loading is now <i>transparent</i> to the user. There are no
<i>load</i> and <i>unload</i> commands: the modules are automatically
loaded when the <i>core</i> requests them and unloaded after some (configurable) time
of inactivity.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Module naming convention</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Every KVIrc module must have an <i>unique</i> name: the name is a single token,
made only of <b>lowercase</b> letters, digits and underscores.
The real object file (library) is named <i>libkvi&lt;name&gt;.so</i>.
This convention allows KVIrc to load modules when they are referenced
by name in the scripting code (the reference in the code is case insensitive
and remapped always to the lowercase version).
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">What a module can do</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Basically, a module exports parts of the scripting language features.
For example, the module <i>about</i> exports the <i>about.kvirc</i> command, that
shows the dialog that lists the KVIrc staff people. The dialog
will be effectively activated only few times (maybe only once) by a single
user: including it in a separate module allows keeping rarely used code out
of the KVIrc executable and saving some memory.
To activate the dialog you only need to execute the command:
</td></tr><tr><td class="example-box"><pre><code class="c"><br>
about.kvirc<br>
</code></pre></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
That's all. KVIrc will load the necessary module, run the <i>/about.kvirc</i> command,
wait until the module is not used anymore and then unload it.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Transparent loading and unloading</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Any command that has the form &lt;name&gt;.&lt;command&gt; is assumed to be
a module reference. KVIrc tries to locate the module named &lt;name&gt;, load it (if
not already in memory) and execute the &lt;command&gt;.
After the command execution KVIrc waits some user defined interval of time
(typically 2-3 minutes) and then check the module state: if the module
has not been referenced again, it is unloaded, otherwise it is kept in memory
for another period of time. To prevent accidentally unloading a module
that has some windows or dialogs open, a module can lock itself in memory.
For example, the 'help' module lock itself when a help browser window is open
and unlocks itself when the last help browser window is closed.<br>
A module can export functions as well: the function names follow
exactly the same rule as the commands: $&lt;name&gt;.&lt;function&gt; is assumed
to be a reference to the &lt;function&gt; exported by module named &lt;name&gt;.
</td></tr><tr><td class="subtitle-table-cell"><div class="subtitle-text">Forced loading and unloading</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
All the modules export a <i>load</i> and a <i>unload</i> command.
</td></tr><tr><td class="example-box"><pre><code class="c"><br>
about.load<br>
</code></pre></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
The example above will do nothing more than loading the <i>about</i>
module into the core memory.
</td></tr><tr><td class="example-box"><pre><code class="c"><br>
about.unload<br>
</code></pre></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
The example above will forcibly unload the module from the core memory;
even if it is still locked.<br>
Please note that this can be dangerous in some situations... so
better check the KVIrc behaviour twice before making public any script
that uses this command.
